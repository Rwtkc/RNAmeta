Description: |
    RNAmeta is an R package designed to facilitate the analysis and visualization of genomic regions,
    such as mRNA, ncRNA, and other genomic features. It provides tools to sample genomic regions, 
    calculate various statistical properties, and generate plots that represent genomic feature distributions.
    The package utilizes genomic annotations and supports various transcript components, including 
    promoters, exons, and UTRs. It enables users to perform in-depth transcriptomic analyses on genomic datasets.

# RNAmeta ðŸŽ‰

**RNAmeta** is a powerful R package designed for RNA sequencing data analysis, with a focus on **visualization** and **preliminary data exploration**. Whether you're analyzing **gene expression**, **splice sites**, or **transcription/translation data**, RNAmeta offers the tools you need to gain insights from your RNA data in a comprehensive and accessible way. ðŸ“Š

## ðŸŒŸ Features Overview

RNAmeta brings together multiple visualization tools to help you dive deep into your RNA sequencing data. Hereâ€™s a quick peek at what you can do:

- ðŸ”¬ **Gene Expression Analysis**  
  Visualize and analyze gene expression data, helping you unlock insights at the gene level.

- ðŸ§¬ **Splice Site Analysis**  
  Explore RNA splicing events and visualize splicing variations that could impact gene function.

- ðŸ“ˆ **Transcription & Translation Analysis**  
  Visualize and interpret changes in transcription and translation data to understand gene regulation.

- ðŸ“Š **Peak Distribution Visualization**  
  Visualize peak distributions across the genome, giving you spatial insights into RNA-seq data.

- ðŸ§© **Comprehensive Data Summarization**  
  Integrate multiple analyses into clear, cohesive visualizations for a big-picture overview.

## ðŸš€ Installation

You can install the `RNAmeta` package from GitHub using the `devtools` package, or download our release version and install it locally:

```R

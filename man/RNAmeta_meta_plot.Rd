\arguments{
\item{bed_file}{Path to the BED file defining genomic regions (sites).
Requires standard BED format columns: chrom, start, end, and optional metadata fields.}

\item{txdb_file}{TxDb object or file path containing transcript annotations.
Supports Bioconductor TxDb packages or SQLite database files with genomic
features including gene IDs, transcript coordinates, and exon structures.}

\item{plot_tx_type}{Which transcript type to plot.
Specifies which transcript type (e.g., "tx", "mRNA", "ncRNA") should be drawn on the plot.
If the specified transcript type is not found in the genome, it will not be plotted.}

\item{sample_model}{The sampling model to be used.
Specifies the method for sampling bases from each genomic site.
Options include "Equidistance" for evenly spaced sampling across the
genomic region, or "random" for randomly selecting bases within the region.
Default: "Equidistance"}

\item{head_or_tail}{Whether to retain the promoter (head) and tail regions.
If set to TRUE, both the promoter and tail regions will be considered in the analysis.
If set to FALSE, these regions will be excluded.
Default: TRUE}

\item{set_group_name}{Group names for the genomic sites.
Specifies the names used to categorize or group different genomic regions
defined in the BED file. This parameter allows users to assign meaningful
labels to different sets of sites based on their biological or experimental
significance.}

\item{set_ambiguity}{Maximum allowed overlap between genomic sites.
Specifies the maximum number of base pairs that can overlap between
different genomic regions defined in the BED file. This parameter helps
control the level of ambiguity when determining overlap between sites.
Default: 5}

\item{set_sample_number}{The number of bases sampled at each genomic site.
Specifies how many bases are selected for analysis or sampling at each
site defined in the BED file. This parameter controls the granularity
of sampling across the genomic regions.
Default: 10}

\item{tx_five_utr_min_length}{Minimum length of the 5' UTR.
Specifies the minimum length for the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of
transcripts. This parameter helps filter out transcripts with shorter
5' UTRs, allowing for a more focused analysis of genes with longer
regulatory regions.
Default: 100}

\item{tx_cds_min_length}{Minimum length of the CDS (coding sequence).
Specifies the minimum length for the coding sequence (CDS) of transcripts.
This parameter allows filtering of transcripts with shorter CDS, ensuring
the analysis focuses on genes with more substantial coding regions.
Default: 100}

\item{tx_three_utr_min_length}{Minimum length of the 3' UTR.
Specifies the minimum length for the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of
transcripts. This parameter helps filter out transcripts with shorter
3' UTRs, allowing for a more focused analysis of genes with longer
regulatory regions.
Default: 100}

\item{tx_long_ncrna_min_length}{Minimum length of long non-coding RNA (lncRNA).
Specifies the minimum length for long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). This
parameter allows filtering of shorter lncRNAs, focusing the analysis
on longer non-coding transcripts that may have more significant biological roles.
Default: 100}

\item{tx_lncrna_overlap_mrna}{Whether to allow overlap between lncRNA and mRNA.
Specifies whether long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are allowed to overlap
with messenger RNAs (mRNAs) in the analysis. If set to TRUE, lncRNAs and
mRNAs can overlap in their genomic regions. If set to FALSE, any overlap
between lncRNA and mRNA regions will be excluded from the analysis.
Default: FALSE}

\item{tx_promoter_length}{Length of the promoter region.
Specifies the length of the promoter region to be considered in the
analysis. This parameter defines the region upstream of the transcription
start site (TSS) that is included for promoter analysis.
Default: 1000}

\item{tx_tail_length}{Length of the tail region.
Specifies the length of the tail region to be considered in the
analysis. This parameter defines the region downstream of the transcription
end site (TES) that is included for tail analysis.
Default: 1000}

\item{tx_ambiguity}{Maximum overlap between transcripts.
Specifies the maximum number of base pairs that can overlap between
different transcripts. This parameter helps control the level of ambiguity
when determining overlap between transcript regions.
Default: 5}

\item{tx_primary_only}{Whether to use only the primary transcript.
If set to TRUE, only the primary transcript will be considered for analysis.
If set to FALSE, all transcripts associated with a gene will be included.
Default: FALSE}

\item{map_filter_transcript}{Whether to filter the length of transcripts to match the original site.
If set to TRUE, only transcripts whose lengths match the length of the original site will be kept.
Default: TRUE}

\item{enable_confidence_interval}{Whether to add a confidence interval (CI) curve.
If set to TRUE, a CI curve will be included in the plot.
If set to FALSE, no CI curve will be drawn.
Default: TRUE}

\item{overlap_index}{Index of site overlap count.
Specifies the number of overlaps between genomic sites to be considered.
Default: 1}

\item{site_length_index}{Index of site length.
Specifies the index used to filter or categorize genomic sites based on their lengths.
Default: 1}

\item{adjustment_factor}{Smoothing level of the curve.
Controls the smoothness of the curve drawn in the analysis. Higher values result in a smoother curve.
Default: 1}

\item{confidence_interval_resampling_time}{Resampling times in density drawing mode.
Specifies the number of resampling iterations to perform when drawing the confidence interval curve.
Default: 1000}

\item{confidence_interval_range}{Range for the confidence interval.
Defines the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval for the plot.
Default: c(0.025, 0.975)}
}
\value{
Returns a plot object showing the distribution of genomic features (such as mRNA, ncRNA, or general transcripts)
based on the sampled points from the provided BED file and transcript annotations.
The plot includes an optional confidence interval curve if specified.
The plot type and content vary depending on the 'plot_tx_type' parameter and the calculated values
for each genomic region sampled from the BED file.
